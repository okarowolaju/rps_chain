# RPS Token

To create a platform which allows anyone to earn RPS tokens by putting up money where their mouth is.  Rock, Paper, Scissor is a simple game where anyone can play with no skill required.  To add excitement to this, we propose a platform where one can buy RPS tokens to play a round of Rock, Paper, Scissor.   The winner of the game would take the winning between the two players, while the platform would take a percentage of the pot for that round.  

The project will include two parts, a front end for users to play the game and make a deposit and a back end which will take in the fiat currency or cryptocurrency, convert to the value of RPS token, deploy a contract so that the winner takes the RPS tokens in the pot.  The contract will also subtract a percentage of the winning.  After the round is over the winner will have RPS tokens deposited to his or her wallet on the platform.


Front end:
Graphics that kind of look like Pokemon game where the user sees three options “Rock” “Paper” “Scissor” and they can see a blank space which would be the opponent’s space.  Unpolished version may just be words.  There would be a countdown 1, 2, 3.  If users don’t press button, the game is a tie, and a higher percentage would be removed from pot for platform.   After one of the buttons is pushed, then that icon or word would show up for both the user and opponent.  A winner would be determined and the person would win the pot. 

Back end:
Convert initial payment from fiat or crypto to RPS token (would need current pricing for crypto); deploy contract to show pot and initiate a contract for winner and platform taking the commission. Convert RPS token back into currency of choice.

Future Prospect:
This is a proof of concept for a possible platform where the solidity programming can be attached to any game, whether virtual or in person, making winning a game more rewarding and exciting.
